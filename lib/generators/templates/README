Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Create a migration and add two column names: "user_picture" & "last_sign_in_picture" to your devise user model which you are using to store user login information

     Run the migrations: rails db:migrate

  2. Add the following to your routes.rb file:
  
     mount Faceauth::Engine, at: "/"

     (NOTE: You may mount it at any path, not just "/")

  3. Ensure you have set "findface_api_key" and "redirect_url" in config/initializers/faceauth.rb
  
     # config.findface_api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
     # config.redirect_url = "root_path" #By default, the option takes root_path of your rails application. 

  5. If you wish to pass your custom model name & column names, please set the names using

     # config.model_name = "your_model_name" (Default is 'User')
     # config.signup_picture_column = "custom_column_name" (Default is 'user_picture')
     # config.signin_picture_column = "custom_column_name" (Default is 'last_sign_in_picture')

  6. You can copy Faceauth views (for customization) to your app by running:

       rails g faceauth:views

                OR

       rails g faceauth:views -v form
